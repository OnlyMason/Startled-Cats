This was a firefox extension that I made for fun, and because cats are funny.  I'm also a dog person.

It grabs the newest submissions from imgur.com's 'startledcats' and 'catgifs' subreddit galleries and shows a random one to you when you click the toolbar button.

I do not claim ownership of any pictures that it may retrieve.
